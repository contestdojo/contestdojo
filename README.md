<p align="center"><sup>an online math contest platform</sup></p>

ContestDojo is an online math competition platform built and used for tournaments such as the
[Stanford Math Tournament](https://sumo.stanford.edu/smt/) and the
[Berkeley Math Tournament](https://bmt.berkeley.edu/home/). The aim of the project is to be a
powerful and customizable site to handle registration, payment, test-taking, and other aspects of
any math contest, eliminating the need for each event to build custom software.
