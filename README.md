<h1 align="center"><sub><img src="./public/logo.svg" height="36"></sub> &nbsp; ContestDojo</h1> <p align="center"><sup>an online math contest platform</sup></p>

ContestDojo is an online math competition platform built and used for tournaments such as the
[Stanford Math Tournament](https://sumo.stanford.edu/smt/) and the
[Berkeley Math Tournament](https://bmt.berkeley.edu/home/).

The aim of the project is to be a powerful and customizable site to handle registration, payment, test-taking, and other
aspects of any math contest, eliminating the need for each event to build custom software.

The project is currently in a closed alpha stage and using it is invite-only. We wish to open the platform up to all
events in the future.
